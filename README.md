## Next Steps

- **Development of a Node.js API to manage portfolio data** 
 - It will allow the direct registration of projects through an administrative panel, making it easier to include and manage project-related information. Additionally, it will simplify the management of the technologies used, eliminating the need for frequent updates to the source code.
